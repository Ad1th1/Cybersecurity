A penetration test, also known as a pen test, is a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable 
vulnerabilities. In the context of web application security, penetration testing is commonly used to augment a web application 
firewall (WAF).

Pen testing can involve the attempted breaching of any number of application systems, (e.g., application protocol interfaces (APIs), 
frontend/backend servers) to uncover vulnerabilities, such as unsanitized inputs that are susceptible to code injection attacks.

Insights provided by the penetration test can be used to fine-tune your WAF security policies and patch detected vulnerabilities.

nmap => to check number of open ports
{
Ports are simply a software abstraction, used to distinguish between communication channels. Similar to the way IP addresses are used to
identify machines on networks, ports identify specific applications in use on a single machine. For example, your web browser will by
default connect to TCP port 80 of machines in HTTP URLs. If you specify the secure HTTPS protocol instead, the browser will try port 443 
by default.

Nmap works with two protocols that use ports: TCP and UDP.
