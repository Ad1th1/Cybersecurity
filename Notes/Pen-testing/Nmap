The first stage in establishing a “map” of the landscape is something called port scanning. 

When a computer runs a network service, it opens a networking construct called a “port” to receive the connection.  Ports are necessary for
making multiple network requests or having multiple services available.

This is done by establishing connections to the remote webservers using different ports on your local machine. Equally, if you want a server
to be able to run more than one service, then you need some way to direct the traffic to the appropriate service. Once again, ports are the
solution to this.

Network connections are made between two ports – an open port listening on the server and a randomly selected port on your own computer. 

Every computer has a total of 65535 available ports.
1024 standard ports
HTTP Webservice = port 80 
HTTPS Webservice = port 443
Windows NETBIOS = port 139 
SMB = port 445 (Server Message Block = share files)
  //wannacry ransomware attack = exploit on vulnerability in SMB version 1

Nmap can be used to perform many different kinds of port scan – the most common of these will be introduced in upcoming tasks; however, the
basic theory is this: nmap will connect to each port of the target in turn. Depending on how the port responds, it can be determined as 
being open, closed, or filtered (usually by a firewall). Once we know which ports are open, we can then look at enumerating which services
are running on each port – either manually, or more commonly using nmap.

Nmap is an extremely powerful tool – made even more powerful by its scripting engine which can be used to scan for vulnerabilities,
and in some cases even perform the exploit directly!
