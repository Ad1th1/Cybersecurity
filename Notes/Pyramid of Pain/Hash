# 1 => Hash
  The hash value is a numeric value of a fixed length that uniquely identifies data. 
  A hash value is the result of a hashing algorithm.
  
  MD5 (Message Digest)
    -> designed by Ron Rivest in 1992 
    -> 128-bit hash value
    -> NOT considered cryptographically secure
  SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)
    -> was invented by United States National Security Agency in 1995. 
    -> SHA-1 takes an input and produces a 160-bit hash value string as a 40 digit hexadecimal number.
    -> banned in 2013, susceptible to brute-force attacks.
  SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) 
    -> designed by NIST and NSA in 2001 to replace SHA-1
    -> most common is SHA-256 -> returns a hash value of 256-bits as a 64 digit hexadecimal number.
    
  A hash is not considered to be cryptographically secure if two files have the same hash value or digest.

  Various online tools can be used to do hash lookups like VirusTotal and Metadefender Cloud - OPSWAT.
