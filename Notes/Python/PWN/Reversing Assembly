What is ELF: 
  > Executable and Linkable format
  > introduced bu UNIX and BSD
  > format for executables, shared libraries, object files, core dumps
  
  > segments = only relevant at run-time
  > sections = only relevant at link-time
  
  > important segments
      > data segment -> contains variables and data
      > code segment
  
  > in a dynamically linked library
      > defines shared libraries to be loaded
      > has it's own data and code segment
      
  > elf header
      > E_IDENT = 16 bytes -> defines how the elf file is going to be parsed
          = bytes 1-4 = 7f 45 4c 46 = elf file
          = byte 5 = class 0 -> none, 1 -> 32-bit objects, 2 -> 64-bit objects 
          = byte 6 = data 0 -> none, 1 -> LSB, 2 -> MSB 
          = byte 7 = version = always 1
          = byte 8 = OS ABI -> 0 = None, 1 = HP-UX, 2 = NetBSD, 3 = Linux
          = byte 9 = ABI version = almost never used
          = byte 10 -16 = padding
