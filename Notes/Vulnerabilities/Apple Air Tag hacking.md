- AirTag is a tracking device developed by Apple. AirTag is designed to act as a key finder, which helps people find personal objects 
- To locate lost items, AirTags use Apple's crowdsourced Find My network, estimated in early 2021 to consist of approximately one billion devices worldwide that detect and anonymously report emitted Bluetooth signals.

- jailbreaking the Apple Airtag

Hardware:
  > -  big silver chip = Apple U1 = a custom chip responsible for the ultra-wide band functionalities of the Airtag
  > - second big chip = Nordic Semiconductor nRF52832 = microcontroller with integrated bluetooth and NFC
  > - 32 MB SPI-flash = Serial Peripheral Interface = simple serial protocol that can talk to a variety of devices, including serial flash devices
  > Flash contents of AirTag contained U1 Firmware and nRF code
  > two test pins were found on which debugging
  > use voltage based fault injection = glitching = take power supply and change it for a very small amount of time -> corrupt memory reads or skip instructions
  > 



Additional Information:
- flash memory = non-volatile storage that is electrically erasable and rewritable
- mosfet: 
 > - metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor
 > - switches by changing voltage between gates
 > - in a p type substrate, have 2 n regios, in between you have a layer of oxide, over which you have a layer of metal
 > - creates a field effect
- BJT : bipolar junction transistors
