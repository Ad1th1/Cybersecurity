Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection, such as from your computer to
your home office or the internet. Packet is the name given to a discrete unit of data in a typical Ethernet network.

Wireshark is the most often-used packet sniffer in the world. Like any other packet sniffer, Wireshark does three things:

Packet Capture: Wireshark listens to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic â€“ quite possibly tens of
thousands of packets at a time.
Filtering: Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters. By applying a filter, you can obtain just
the information you need to see.
Visualization: Wireshark, like any good packet sniffer, allows you to dive right into the very middle of a network packet. It also allows
you to visualize entire conversations and network streams.
