-> DNS (Domain Name System) provides a simple way for us to communicate with devices on the internet without remembering complex numbers. 
-> Every computer on the internet has its own unique address to communicate with it called an IP address. 
-> An IP address = 4 sets of digits ranging from 0 - 255 separated by a period. 

Root, Top-level, Second-level domain

TLD (Top-Level Domain)
-> A TLD is the most righthand part of a domain name. Eg: .com. 
-> two types of TLD
    -> gTLD (Generic Top Level) = meant to tell the user the domain name's purpose; 
Eg: a .com would be for commercial purposes, .org for an organisation, .edu for education and .gov for government.
    -> ccTLD (Country Code Top Level Domain) = for geographical purposes,
 Eg: .ca for sites based in Canada, .co.uk for sites based in the United Kingdom and so on. 

-> Second-Level Domain
    -> Taking tryhackme.com as an example, the .com part is the TLD, and tryhackme is the Second Level Domain. 
    
Subdomain
-> in the name admin.tryhackme.com the admin part is the subdomain. 
-> no limit to the number of subdomains you can create for your domain name.


DNS Records
-> instructions - authoritative DNS servers - provide information about a domain, IP address and how to handle requests for that domain. 
-> consist of a series of text files written in what is known as DNS syntax. 
-> DNS syntax - string of characters used as commands that tell the DNS server what to do. 
-> DNS records also have a ‘TTL’.

A Record:
- resolve to IPv4 addresses, for example 104.26.10.229

AAAA Record:
- resolve to IPv6 addresses, for example 2606:4700:20::681a:be5

CNAME Record
- resolve to another domain name

MX Record
- resolve to the address of the servers that handle the email for the domain you are querying
- come with a priority flag. 
- tells the client in which order to try the servers, this is perfect for if the main server goes down and email needs to be sent to a backup server.

TXT Record
- free text fields where any text-based data can be stored. 
- multiple uses, but some common ones can be to list servers that have the authority to send an email on behalf of the domain (this can help in the battle against spam and spoofed email). They can also be used to verify ownership of the domain name when signing up for third party services.
