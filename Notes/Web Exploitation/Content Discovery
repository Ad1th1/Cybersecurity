Robots.txt
  ~ a document that tells search engines which pages they are and aren't allowed to show on their search engine results or ban 
  specific search engines from crawling the website altogether. These pages may be areas such as administration portals or files
  meant for the website's customers.
  
Favicon
  ~ a small icon displayed in the browser's address bar or tab used for branding a website.
Sometimes when frameworks are used to build a website, a favicon that is part of the installation gets leftover, and if the website 
developer doesn't replace this with a custom one, this can give us a clue on what framework is in use. 

OWASP host a database of common framework icons that you can use to check against the targets favicon 
https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database. 

Sitemap.xml
  ~ sitemap.xml file gives a list of every file the website owner wishes to be listed on a search engine. 
  These can sometimes contain areas of the website that are a bit more difficult to navigate to or even list some old webpages that 
  the current site no longer uses but are still working behind the scenes.
