There are 3 specific protocols involved to facilitate the outgoing and incoming email messages, and they are briefly listed below.

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - It is utilized to handle the sending of emails. 
POP3 (Post Office Protocol) - Is responsible transferring email between a client and a mail server. 
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) - Is responsible transferring email between a client and a mail server. 


Difference between POP3 and IMAP

POP3

Emails are downloaded and stored on a single device.
Sent messages are stored on the single device from which the email was sent.
Emails can only be accessed from the single device the emails were downloaded to.
If you want to keep messages on the server, make sure the setting "Keep email on server" is enabled, or all messages are deleted 
from the server once downloaded to the single device's app or software.

IMAP
Emails are stored on the server and can be downloaded to multiple devices.
Sent messages are stored on the server.
Messages can be synced and accessed across multiple devices.

There are two parts to an email:
-> The email header (information about the email, such as the email servers that relayed the email)
-> the email body (text and/or HTML formatted text)
-> The syntax for email messages is known as the Internet Message Format (IMF).

From - the sender's email address
Subject - the email's subject line
Date - the date when the email was sent
To - the recipient's email address

other email header fields of interest. 

X-Originating-IP - The IP address of the email was sent from (this is known as an X-header)
Smtp.mailfrom/header.from - The domain the email was sent from (these headers are within Authentication-Results)
Reply-To - This is the email address a reply email will be sent to instead of the From email address

Most of the time, it appears that email is passed directly from the sender directly to the recipient. This isn't necessarily true: A typical email passes through at least four computers.

A URI - Uniform Resource Identifier - a sequence of characters that identifies a web resource by location, name, or both in the World Wide Web. There are two types of URIs: 
  URNs (Uniform Resource Names) and URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).
  
URI	
-> Resource identifier	
-> Superset of URL	
-> It is often utilized in XML  and tag library files such as JSTL and XSLT to identify resources and binaries.	
-> Its primary purpose is to identify a resource and differentiate it from other resources either by using location, name  or both.
-> The scheme can be anything from protocol to designation and specification	

URL
-> Resource locator  
-> Type of URI
-> Its primary purpose is to identify a resource and differentiate it from other resources either by using 
location, name  or both.
-> Its primary goal is to get the address or location of a resource
-> Often used to find webpages
-> The scheme is usually a protocol such as https, HTTP, FTP, and LDAP, among others
