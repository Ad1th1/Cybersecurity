->  Burp Suite is a framework written in Java that aims to provide a one-stop-shop for web application penetration testing.
-> Burp can capture and manipulate all of the traffic between an attacker and a webserver. 
-> After capturing requests, we can choose to send them to various other parts of the Burp Suite framework. This ability to intercept, view,
and modify web requests prior to them being sent to the target server, makes Burp Suite perfect for any kind of manual web app testing.

-> Proxy: 
  ~ most well-known aspect of Burp Suite
  ~ allows us to intercept and modify requests/responses when interacting with web applications.
 
-> Repeater: 
  ~ The second most well-known Burp feature
  ~ allows us to capture, modify, then resend the same request numerous times. 
  ~ awesome when we need to craft a payload through trial and error or when testing the functionality of an endpoint for flaws.
  
-> Intruder: 
  ~ allows us to spray an endpoint with requests
  ~ often used for bruteforce attacks or to fuzz endpoints.
Decoder: 
  ~ provides a valuable service when transforming data 
  ~ in terms of decoding captured information, or encoding a payload prior to sending it to the target.

Comparer
  ~ Comparer allows us to compare two pieces of data at either word or byte level. 
  ~ is able to send (potentially very large) pieces of data directly into a comparison tool with a single keyboard shortcut 

Sequencer: 
  ~ used when assessing the randomness of tokens such as session cookie values or other supposedly random generated data. 
  ~ If the algorithm is not generating secure random values, then this could open up some devastating avenues for attack.
