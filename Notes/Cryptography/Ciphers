-> The Caesar cipher
    ~ a shift cipher 
    ~ oldest and most famous ciphers in history
    ~ each letter is shifted a fixed number of steps in the alphabet
    
-> Monoalphabetic substitution cipher
    ~ Each letter is substituted by another letter in the alphabet. 
    ~ If it contains word boundaries (spaces and punctuation), it is called an Aristocrat.
    ~ The more difficult variant, without word boundaries, is called a Patristocrat.

-> Atbash Cipher 
    ~ called mirror code
    ~ believed to be the first cipher ever
    ~ you simply reverse the alphabet, so A becomes Z, B becomes Y and so on.

-> Vigenère cipher 
    ~ an improvement of the Caesar cipher, by using a sequence of shifts instead of applying the same shift to every letter.
    ~ variant of the Vigenère cipher, which uses numbers instead of letters to describe the sequence of shifts, is called a Gronsfeld cipher
    ~ Gronsfeld ciphers can be solved as well through the Vigenère tool.

-> Vigenère Autokey Cipher 
    ~ a more secure variant of the ordinary Vigenère cipher
    ~ encrypts the first letters in the same way as an ordinary Vigenère cipher, but after all letters in the key have been used it doesn't
    repeat the sequence. Instead it begins using letters from the plaintext as key.

-> Beaufort Cipher 
    ~ similar to the Vigenère cipher, but uses a different "tabula recta"
    ~ plaintext letter is subtracted from the key letter instead of adding them
    ~ reciprocal (the encryption and decryption algorithms are the same).

-> Base64
    ~ used to encode anything into printable ASCII-characters
    ~ consists of letters (about 50% uppercase and 50% lowercase), as well as numbers, and often equal-characters (=) at the end.
