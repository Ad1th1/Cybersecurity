-> It is a process to convert information to a shorter fixed value known as the key that is used to represent the original information. 
-> The purpose of hashing is indexing and retrieving items from the database. The process is very fast.	
-> The hash code or key can not be reversed to the original information by any means. It can only be mapped and the hash code is checked 
if the hash code is the same the information is the same otherwise not. The original information can not be retrieved.
-> It is more secure in comparison to encryption.
