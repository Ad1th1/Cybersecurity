HCI = Human Computer Interaction
  -> remember that human component needs to be integrated into 
  -> study of how humans interact with technology
  -> Users, Task, Context, Design, Evaluation
  
  -> Usability = way to measure and understand how easy it is for a person to use a device
    -> speed = how quickly can the task be accomplished = timing
    -> efficiency = number of mistakes made in accomplishing the task = count errors
    -> learnability = how easy is it to learn to use the system = graphs
    -> memorability = how easy is it remember how to use the system, once learnt = graphs
    -> user preference = what does a user like = questionnaires/surveys
    
    Task = goal that a user sets out to accomplish in a system,

Consider working memory of people
George A Miller = we can hold 7 +/- 2 pieces of information

Chunking
-> Create passwords using chunking

Mental Models
-> while using software
-> Mappind, visibility and feedback
-> Constraints

 -> labels = explain what's going on in the system
 -> Affordances = help a user figure out what to do
 -> Constraints = prevent users from doing the wrong thing
 -> Mapping = between the controls and the actual functionality
 -> Conventions = users have come to expect these from controls and system interaction 
 
 If we put all these things together along with our understanding of users' experiences, both in general, outside in the world and with software. 
 It can help us better understand what the user will expect when they come in to use the system. And how we can design it to be more usable. And,
 eventually, for our concerns, more secure.
